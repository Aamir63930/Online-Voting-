**Online Voting System in Python**

This project is a simple yet effective online voting system built using Python. It allows users to cast their votes securely and ensures that each user can vote only once. The system can be used for small-scale elections such as school elections, club polls, or community decisions.

**Key Features:**

* User registration and login system
* Candidate management (add, view, and delete candidates)
* Voting mechanism with one vote per user
* Real-time vote counting and result display
* Admin panel for managing users and results
* Data stored using file handling or a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite)

**Technologies Used:**

* Python (Core logic)
* Optional: Tkinter for GUI or Flask for web interface
* File handling / SQLite for data storage

This system demonstrates practical use of Python for handling user input, authentication, data persistence, and decision-making processes.
